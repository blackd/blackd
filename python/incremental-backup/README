Incremental backup with rsync


I have created this script to create incremental backups using rsync and the 
online storage service  http://onlinestoragesolution.com/.
But it can be used with any rsync server.

Requirements:
    Python 2.6 or later 2.x (not fully testet with 3.x)

    pexpect module (http://pexpect.sourceforge.net/pexpect.html) used to
            supply password to ssh (not available for python 3.x)

Usage:
    $ inc-rsync TYPE SOURCE TARGET

TYPE can be "full", "inc", "continue"

So to start new backup you have to make one "full" backup.
I recomend that TARGET is an empty dir.

    $ inc-rsync full SOURCE TARGET

This will create new directory on TARGET with name like TARGET/2010-11-21T12:19/
and a symlink TARGET\latest pointing to the above directory.

To create incremental backups run:

    $ inc-rsync inc SOURCE TARGET

This will create new directory on TARGET with name TARGET/CURRENT_DATE_TIME/.
The symlink TARGET\latest will be updated to point to the new dir and a symlink
TARGET\prev will be created that points to the previous dir.

The created incremental backups as space efficient because --link-dest option of
rsync is used so every incremental will hardlink to the unchanged files of the 
previous and every incremental will look like a full copy of the source at that
point in time.

You need to make incremental backus from time to time (cron job is the best way
to do it)


If for some reason an incremental or full backup fails use:

    $ inc-rsync continue SOURCE TARGET
